TradeTrax is a general purpose trading tool for keeping track of marketable 
goods. While it builds heavily on stock market terminology for abstraction 
purposes, it is actually meant to be used for managing all kinds of assets 
that are bought for resale, for example:

    * Collectibles (trading cards, stamps, coins, ...)
    * Auction house items (Ebay, MMORPGs)
    * Speculation portfolios (forex assets, bitcoins, gold bullions,...)

TradeTrax was born out of a need to replace pen&paper records as well as Excel 
spreadsheets with something more robust and straightforward.
